# Gesture-Controlled-Robot

This project consists of two parts which are receiver and transmitter.
In the transmitter part (glove), you need Arduino Nano, Mpu6050 Gyro
sensor, nRF24L01 wireless sensor and 9V battery. You should
connected to the Arduino and sensors with jumpers on the breadboard.
nRf24L01 is the connection between the transmitter and the receiver.
In the receiver part (car), you need two car bodies, two DC
motors, and a drunk wheel. Also, you need Arduino Uno, a motor driver, and
battery bed. You should connected the dc motors to the motor driver and Arduino.
